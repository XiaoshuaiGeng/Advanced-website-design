          <h2>b. What is the minimum internet speed (connection speed) you may consider as a web designer and why?</h2>
          <h3>I may consider 5Mbps as the minimum speed becasue there are many websites add a lot
          videos and images on their websites. It requires a stable internet connection to load them. The network in my home has very unstable connection
        that most of the time I cannot load the webpages properly, therefore I suggest a stable 5Mbps network as the minimum internet speed.</h3>
