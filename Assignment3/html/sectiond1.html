  <h2>a.	Write the result.  </h2>
    <h3>The result is : 450
90
700
800</h3>
  <h2>b.	For each variable. explain the order of the arithmetic operations.  </h2>
  <h3>For var x = (100+50)*a, (100+50) was calculated first then multiplied by a
    <br>
    For var y=x*2/10, the calculation just goes sequentially, x*2 was calculated and then divide by 10.
    <br>
    For var z=x*2-200, x*2 was first calculated then minus 200 from it.
    <br>
    For var w=z+2*50, 2*50 was calculated then added to z which will have the result 800.
